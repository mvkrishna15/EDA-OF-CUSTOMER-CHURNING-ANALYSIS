# Customer Churn Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of customers to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn. The objective is to derive insights from the data to help businesses improve retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer information, including demographic details, subscription data, and churn status. Key features include:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **SeniorCitizen**: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen.
- **TotalCharges**: Total amount charged to the customer.
- **Churn**: Indicates if the customer has churned.

## Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Analyze the distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.
- Explore relationships between churn and various customer attributes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Replaced missing or invalid values in the `TotalCharges` column.
   - Converted `SeniorCitizen` values for better interpretability.
   - Checked for and handled duplicates.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Visualized customer churn distribution using count plots and pie charts.
   - Analyzed churn patterns by attributes like gender and senior citizen status.

3. **Insights Extraction**:
   - Derived actionable insights for improving customer retention.

## Visualizations

- **Count Plot**: Distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.
- **Pie Chart**: Percentage of churned customers.
- **Count Plots**: Churn distribution by demographic variables (e.g., gender).

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## Insights

Key takeaways from the analysis include:
- Distribution of churned customers by demographic groups.
- Identification of features strongly correlated with customer churn.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or a similar platform.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
